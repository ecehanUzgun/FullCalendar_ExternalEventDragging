  - Dynamic Calendar: Fully interactive calendar with support for different views (Month, Week, Day).
  - Event Removal: Option to remove events from the external panel after they are dropped.
  - Responsive Design: Optimized for different screen sizes and devices.
    
## Technologies Used
  - ASP.NET Core MVC: Backend framework for creating the application structure.
  - FullCalendar Scheduler: JavaScript library for creating interactive calendars.
  - Bootstrap: For responsive design and styling.
  - HTML5 & CSS3: For layout and customization.
